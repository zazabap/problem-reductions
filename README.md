A Rust library for NP-hard problem definitions and reductions. We aim to implement [100+ problems and reduction rules](https://codingthrust.github.io/problem-reductions/) between them, with automatic reduction path search. Built with AI assistance.

This infrastructure aims to solve two problems:
- Given a hard problem $A$, reduce it to the most viable problem $B$, to be solved efficiently with an external solver.
- Given a solver $S$ for problem $B$, explore how efficiently it can be used for solving other problems.

## Installation

### As a library

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
problemreductions = "0.2"
```

### CLI tool

Install the `pred` command-line tool for exploring the reduction graph from your terminal:

```bash
cargo install problemreductions-cli
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodingThrust/problem-reductions
cd problem-reductions
make cli    # builds target/release/pred
```

See the [Getting Started](https://codingthrust.github.io/problem-reductions/getting-started.html) guide for usage examples, the reduction workflow, and [CLI usage](https://codingthrust.github.io/problem-reductions/cli.html).

## MCP Server (AI Integration)

The `pred` CLI includes a built-in [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for AI assistant integration (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenCode, etc.).

Add to your client's MCP config file:

```json
{"mcpServers": {"problemreductions": {"command": "pred", "args": ["mcp"]}}}
```

| Client | Config file |
|--------|------------|
| Claude Code / Desktop | `.mcp.json` or `~/.claude/mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |
| OpenCode | `opencode.json` (use `{"mcp": {"problemreductions": {"type": "local", "command": ["pred", "mcp"]}}}`) |

See the [MCP documentation](https://codingthrust.github.io/problem-reductions/mcp.html) for available tools, prompts, and full configuration details.

## Contributing

**No programming experience required.** You contribute domain knowledge; we handle the implementation.

1. **File an issue** — use the [Problem](https://github.com/CodingThrust/problem-reductions/issues/new?template=problem.md) or [Rule](https://github.com/CodingThrust/problem-reductions/issues/new?template=rule.md) template. Describe the problem or reduction you have in mind — the template guides you through the details.
2. **We implement it** — for reasonable requests, maintainers tag the issue `implement` and AI agents generate a tested implementation.
3. **We present it to you** — all issue contributors are invited to community calls (via [Zulip](https://problem-reductions.zulipchat.com/)), where maintainers walk through the implementation — documentation, CLI behavior, correctness — and you provide feedback.

**Authorship:** contribute 10 non-trivial reduction rules and you'll be added to the author list of the [paper](https://codingthrust.github.io/problem-reductions/reductions.pdf).

> **Tip:** If you use Claude Code / OpenCode / Codex, you can file issues interactively:
> ```
> File an issue on CodingThrust/problem-reductions, using the "Model" issue template, about the Closest Vector Problem. Brainstorm with me.
> ```

If you prefer to **implement yourself**, see the [Design](https://codingthrust.github.io/problem-reductions/design.html) guide. Run `make help` to see available developer commands.

## Acknowledgments

This project draws inspiration from the following packages:

- **[ProblemReductions.jl](https://github.com/GiggleLiu/ProblemReductions.jl)** — Julia library for computational problem reductions. Our problem trait hierarchy, reduction interface (`ReduceTo`/`ReductionResult`), and graph-based reduction registry are directly inspired by this package.
- **[UnitDiskMapping.jl](https://github.com/QuEraComputing/UnitDiskMapping.jl)** — Julia package for mapping problems to unit disk graphs. Our unit disk graph (King's subgraph / triangular lattice) reductions and the copy-line method are based on this implementation.
- **[qubogen](https://github.com/tamuhey/qubogen)** — Python library for generating QUBO matrices from combinatorial problems. Our QUBO reduction formulas (Vertex Cover, Graph Coloring, Set Packing, Max-2-SAT, binary ILP) reference the implementations in this package.
