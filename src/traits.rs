//! Core traits for problem definitions.

/// This trait defines the interface for computational problems that can be
/// solved by enumeration or reduction to other problems.

    /// Used for generating variant IDs in the reduction graph schema.

/// Implemented automatically by [`declare_variants!`] for each concrete type.
/// The [`#[reduction]`] proc macro checks this trait at compile time to ensure
/// all reduction source/target types have been declared.
