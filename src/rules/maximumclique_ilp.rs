//! Reduction from MaximumClique to ILP (Integer Linear Programming).
//!
//! The MaximumClique problem can be formulated as a binary ILP:
//! - Variables: One binary variable per vertex (0 = not selected, 1 = selected)
//! - Constraints: x_u + x_v <= 1 for each NON-EDGE (u, v) - if two vertices are not adjacent,
//!   at most one can be in the clique
//! - Objective: Maximize the sum of weights of selected vertices
