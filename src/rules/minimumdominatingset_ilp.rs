//! Reduction from MinimumDominatingSet to ILP (Integer Linear Programming).
//!
//! The Dominating Set problem can be formulated as a binary ILP:
//! - Variables: One binary variable per vertex (0 = not selected, 1 = selected)
//! - Constraints: For each vertex v: x_v + sum_{u in N(v)} x_u >= 1
//!   (v or at least one of its neighbors must be selected)
//! - Objective: Minimize the sum of weights of selected vertices

/// Result of reducing MinimumDominatingSet to ILP.
///
/// This reduction creates a binary ILP where:
/// - Each vertex corresponds to a binary variable
/// - For each vertex v, the constraint x_v + sum_{u in N(v)} x_u >= 1 ensures
///   that v is dominated (either v itself or one of its neighbors is selected)
/// - The objective minimizes the total weight of selected vertices
