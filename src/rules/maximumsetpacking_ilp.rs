//! Reduction from MaximumSetPacking to ILP (Integer Linear Programming).
//!
//! The Set Packing problem can be formulated as a binary ILP:
//! - Variables: One binary variable per set (0 = not selected, 1 = selected)
//! - Constraints: x_i + x_j <= 1 for each overlapping pair (i, j)
//! - Objective: Maximize the sum of weights of selected sets
