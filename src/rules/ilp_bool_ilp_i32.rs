//! Natural embedding of binary ILP into general integer ILP.
//!
//! Every binary (0-1) variable is a valid non-negative integer variable.
//! The constraints carry over unchanged. Additional upper-bound constraints
//! (x_i <= 1) are added to preserve binary semantics.
//!
//! This is a same-name variant cast (ILP → ILP), so by convention it does not
//! have an example file or a paper `reduction-rule` entry.
