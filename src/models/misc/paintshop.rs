//! Paint Shop problem implementation.
//!
//! In the Paint Shop problem, we have a sequence of cars to paint.
//! Each car appears exactly twice in the sequence and must be painted
//! one color at its first occurrence and another at its second.
//! The goal is to minimize color switches between adjacent positions.
