/// Sequencing Within Intervals problem.
///
/// Given `n` tasks, each with release time `r(t)`, deadline `d(t)`, and processing
/// length `l(t)`, determine whether there exists a schedule `sigma: T -> Z_>=0`
/// such that:
/// - `sigma(t) >= r(t)` (task starts no earlier than its release time)
/// - `sigma(t) + l(t) <= d(t)` (task finishes by its deadline)
/// - No two tasks overlap in time
///
/// This is problem SS1 from Garey & Johnson (1979), NP-complete via Theorem 3.8.
///
/// # Representation
///
/// Each task has a variable representing its start time offset from the release time.
/// Variable `i` takes values in `{0, ..., d(i) - r(i) - l(i)}`, so the actual start
/// time is `r(i) + config[i]`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use problemreductions::models::misc::SequencingWithinIntervals;
/// use problemreductions::{Problem, Solver, BruteForce};
///
/// // 3 tasks: release_times = [0, 2, 4], deadlines = [3, 5, 7], lengths = [2, 2, 2]
/// let problem = SequencingWithinIntervals::new(vec![0, 2, 4], vec![3, 5, 7], vec![2, 2, 2]);
/// let solver = BruteForce::new();
/// let solution = solver.find_satisfying(&problem);
/// assert!(solution.is_some());
