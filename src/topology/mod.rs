//! Graph topology types.
//!
//! - [`SimpleGraph`]: Standard unweighted graph (default for most problems)
//! - [`PlanarGraph`]: Planar graph
//! - [`BipartiteGraph`]: Bipartite graph
//! - [`DirectedGraph`]: Directed graph (digraph)
//! - [`MixedGraph`]: Mixed graph with directed arcs and undirected edges
//! - [`UnitDiskGraph`]: Vertices with 2D positions, edges based on distance
//! - [`KingsSubgraph`]: 8-connected grid graph (King's graph)
//! - [`TriangularSubgraph`]: Triangular lattice subgraph
//! - [`DirectedGraph`]: Directed graph (for problems like `MinimumFeedbackVertexSet`)
