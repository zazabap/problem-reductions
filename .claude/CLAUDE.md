# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
Rust library for NP-hard problem reductions. Implements computational problems with reduction rules for transforming between equivalent formulations.

## Skills
These repo-local skills live under `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`.

- [issue-to-pr](skills/issue-to-pr/SKILL.md) -- Convert a GitHub issue into a PR with an implementation plan. One item per PR: `[Rule]` issues require both models to exist on `main`; never bundle model + rule in the same PR.
- [add-model](skills/add-model/SKILL.md) -- Add a new problem model. Can be used standalone (brainstorms with user) or called from `issue-to-pr`.
- [add-rule](skills/add-rule/SKILL.md) -- Add a new reduction rule. Can be used standalone (brainstorms with user) or called from `issue-to-pr`.
- [review-implementation](skills/review-implementation/SKILL.md) -- Review implementation completeness by dispatching parallel subagents (structural + quality) with fresh context. Auto-detects new models/rules from git diff. Called automatically at the end of `add-model`/`add-rule`, after each `executing-plans` batch, or standalone via `/review-implementation`.
- [fix-pr](skills/fix-pr/SKILL.md) -- Resolve PR review comments (user + Copilot), fix CI failures, and address codecov coverage gaps. Uses `gh api` for codecov (not local `cargo-llvm-cov`).
- [write-model-in-paper](skills/write-model-in-paper/SKILL.md) -- Write or improve a problem-def entry in the Typst paper (standalone, for improving existing entries). Core instructions are inlined in `add-model` Step 6.
- [write-rule-in-paper](skills/write-rule-in-paper/SKILL.md) -- Write or improve a reduction-rule entry in the Typst paper (standalone, for improving existing entries). Core instructions are inlined in `add-rule` Step 5.
- [release](skills/release/SKILL.md) -- Create a new crate release. Determines version bump from diff, verifies tests/clippy, then runs `make release`.
- [check-issue](skills/check-issue/SKILL.md) -- Quality gate for `[Rule]` and `[Model]` issues. Checks usefulness, non-triviality, correctness of literature, and writing quality. Posts structured report and adds failure labels.
- [topology-sanity-check](skills/topology-sanity-check/SKILL.md) -- Run sanity checks on the reduction graph: detect orphan (isolated) problems and redundant reduction rules.
  - `topology-sanity-check orphans` -- Detect isolated problem types (runs `examples/detect_isolated_problems.rs`)
  - `topology-sanity-check np-hardness` -- Verify NP-hardness proof chains from 3-SAT (runs `examples/detect_unreachable_from_3sat.rs`)
  - `topology-sanity-check redundancy [source target]` -- Check for dominated reduction rules
- [project-pipeline](skills/project-pipeline/SKILL.md) -- Pick a Ready issue from the GitHub Project board, move it through In Progress -> issue-to-pr --execute -> Review pool.
- [review-pipeline](skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md) -- Pick a PR from Review pool column, fix Copilot review comments, run structural completeness check, fix CI, run agentic feature tests, move to Final review.
- [propose](skills/propose/SKILL.md) -- Interactive brainstorming to help domain experts propose a new model or rule. Asks one question at a time, uses mathematical language (no programming jargon), and files a GitHub issue.
- [final-review](skills/final-review/SKILL.md) -- Interactive maintainer review for PRs in "Final review" column. Assesses usefulness, safety, completeness, quality ranking, then merge or hold.
- [dev-setup](skills/dev-setup/SKILL.md) -- Interactive wizard to install and configure all development tools for new maintainers.

## Codex Compatibility
- Claude slash commands such as `/issue-to-pr 42 --execute` are aliases for the matching repo-local skill files under `.claude/skills/`.
- In Codex, read the relevant `SKILL.md` directly and follow it; do not assume slash-command support exists.
- The Makefile targets `run-plan`, `run-issue`, `run-pipeline`, and `run-review` already translate these workflows into explicit `SKILL.md` prompts for Codex.
- The default Codex model in the Makefile is `gpt-5.4`. Override it with `CODEX_MODEL=<model>` if needed.

## Git Safety
- **NEVER force push** (`git push --force`, `git push -f`, `git push --force-with-lease`). This is an absolute rule with no exceptions. Force push can silently destroy other people's work and stashed changes.

## Architecture

### Core Modules
- `src/models/` - Problem implementations organized by input structure:
  - `graph/` - Graph-input problems
  - `formula/` - Boolean formulas and circuits
  - `set/` - Set systems (universe + subsets)
  - `algebraic/` - Matrices, linear systems, lattices
  - `misc/` - Unique input structures
  - Run `pred list` for the full catalog of problems, variants, and reductions; `pred show <name>` for details on a specific problem
- `src/rules/` - Reduction rules + inventory registration
- `src/solvers/` - BruteForce solver, ILP solver (feature-gated)
- `src/traits.rs` - `Problem`, `OptimizationProblem`, `SatisfactionProblem` traits
- `src/rules/traits.rs` - `ReduceTo<T>`, `ReductionResult` traits
- `src/registry/` - Compile-time reduction metadata collection
- `problemreductions-cli/` - `pred` CLI tool (separate crate in workspace)
- `src/unit_tests/` - Unit test files (mirroring `src/` structure, referenced via `#[path]`)
- `tests/main.rs` - Integration tests (modules in `tests/suites/`); example tests use `include!` for direct invocation (no subprocess)
- `tests/data/` - Ground truth JSON for integration tests
- `scripts/` - Python test data generation scripts (managed with `uv`)
- `docs/plans/` - Implementation plans

### Trait Hierarchy

```
Problem (core trait — all problems must implement)
│
├── const NAME: &'static str           // e.g., "MaximumIndependentSet"
├── type Metric: Clone                 // SolutionSize<W> for optimization, bool for satisfaction
├── fn dims(&self) -> Vec<usize>       // config space: [2, 2, 2] for 3 binary variables
├── fn evaluate(&self, config) -> Metric
├── fn variant() -> Vec<(&str, &str)>  // e.g., [("graph","SimpleGraph"), ("weight","i32")]
├── fn num_variables(&self) -> usize   // default: dims().len()
└── fn problem_type() -> ProblemType   // catalog bridge: registry lookup by NAME

OptimizationProblem : Problem<Metric = SolutionSize<Self::Value>> (extension for optimization)
│
├── type Value: PartialOrd + Clone     // inner objective type (i32, f64, etc.)
└── fn direction(&self) -> Direction   // Maximize or Minimize

SatisfactionProblem : Problem<Metric = bool> (marker trait for decision problems)
```

**Satisfaction problems** (e.g., `Satisfiability`) use `Metric = bool` and implement `SatisfactionProblem`.

**Optimization problems** (e.g., `MaximumIndependentSet`) use `Metric = SolutionSize<W>` where:
```rust
enum SolutionSize<T> { Valid(T), Invalid }  // Invalid = infeasible config
enum Direction { Maximize, Minimize }
```

### Key Patterns
- `variant_params!` macro implements `Problem::variant()` — e.g., `crate::variant_params![G, W]` for two type params, `crate::variant_params![]` for none (see `src/variant.rs`)
- `declare_variants!` proc macro registers concrete type instantiations with best-known complexity and registry-backed dynamic dispatch metadata — every entry must specify `opt` or `sat`, and one entry per problem may be marked `default` (see `src/models/graph/maximum_independent_set.rs`). Variable names in complexity strings are validated at compile time against actual getter methods.
- Problems parameterized by graph type `G` and optionally weight type `W` (problem-dependent)
- `ReductionResult` provides `target_problem()` and `extract_solution()`
- `Solver::find_best()` → `Option<Vec<usize>>` for optimization problems; `Solver::find_satisfying()` → `Option<Vec<usize>>` for `Metric = bool`
- `BruteForce::find_all_best()` / `find_all_satisfying()` return `Vec<Vec<usize>>` for all optimal/satisfying solutions
- Graph types: SimpleGraph, PlanarGraph, BipartiteGraph, UnitDiskGraph, KingsSubgraph, TriangularSubgraph
- Weight types: `One` (unit weight marker), `i32`, `f64` — all implement `WeightElement` trait
- `WeightElement` trait: `type Sum: NumericSize` + `fn to_sum(&self)` — converts weight to a summable numeric type
- Weight management via inherent methods (`weights()`, `set_weights()`, `is_weighted()`), not traits
- `NumericSize` supertrait bundles common numeric bounds (`Clone + Default + PartialOrd + Num + Zero + Bounded + AddAssign + 'static`)

### Overhead System
Reduction overhead is expressed using `Expr` AST (in `src/expr.rs`) with the `#[reduction]` macro. The `overhead` attribute is **required** — omitting it is a compile error:
```rust
#[reduction(overhead = {
    num_vertices = "num_vertices + num_clauses",
    num_edges = "3 * num_clauses",
})]
impl ReduceTo<Target> for Source { ... }
```
- Expression strings are parsed at compile time by a Pratt parser in the proc macro crate
- Variable names are validated against actual getter methods on the source type — typos cause compile errors
- Each problem type provides inherent getter methods (e.g., `num_vertices()`, `num_edges()`) that the overhead expressions reference
- `ReductionOverhead` stores `Vec<(&'static str, Expr)>` — field name to symbolic expression mappings
- `ReductionEntry` has both symbolic (`overhead_fn`) and compiled (`overhead_eval_fn`) evaluation — the compiled version calls getters directly
- `VariantEntry` has both a complexity string and compiled `complexity_eval_fn` — same pattern
- Expressions support: constants, variables, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `exp()`, `log()`, `sqrt()`, `factorial()`
- Complexity strings must use **concrete numeric values only** (e.g., `"2^(2.372 * num_vertices / 3)"`, not `"2^(omega * num_vertices / 3)"`)
- `Expr::parse()` provides runtime parsing for cross-check tests that compare compiled vs symbolic evaluation

### Problem Names
Problem types use explicit optimization prefixes (`Maximum...`, `Minimum...`) or no prefix. Run `pred list` for the full catalog. Common aliases (e.g., `MIS` → `MaximumIndependentSet`, `MVC` → `MinimumVertexCover`) are shown in the `Aliases` column.

### Problem Variants
Reduction graph nodes use variant key-value pairs from `Problem::variant()`:
- Base: `MaximumIndependentSet` (empty variant = defaults)
- Graph variant: `MaximumIndependentSet {graph: "KingsSubgraph", weight: "One"}`
- Weight variant: `MaximumIndependentSet {graph: "SimpleGraph", weight: "f64"}`
- Default variant ranking: `SimpleGraph`, `One`, `KN` are considered default values; variants with the most default values sort first
- Nodes come exclusively from `#[reduction]` registrations; natural edges between same-name variants are inferred from the graph/weight subtype partial order
- Each primitive reduction is determined by the exact `(source_variant, target_variant)` endpoint pair
- `#[reduction]` accepts only `overhead = { ... }`

### Extension Points
- New models register dynamic load/serialize/brute-force dispatch through `declare_variants!` in the model file, not by adding manual match arms in the CLI
- Exact registry dispatch lives in `src/registry/`; alias resolution and partial/default variant resolution live in `problemreductions-cli/src/problem_name.rs`
- `pred create` UX lives in `problemreductions-cli/src/commands/create.rs`
- Canonical paper and CLI examples live in `src/example_db/model_builders.rs` and `src/example_db/rule_builders.rs`

## Conventions

### File Naming
- Reduction files: `src/rules/<source>_<target>.rs` (e.g., `maximumindependentset_qubo.rs`)
- Model files: `src/models/<category>/<name>.rs` — category is by input structure: `graph/` (graph input), `formula/` (boolean formula/circuit), `set/` (universe + subsets), `algebraic/` (matrix/linear system/lattice), `misc/` (other)
- Canonical examples: builder functions in `src/example_db/rule_builders.rs` and `src/example_db/model_builders.rs`
- Example binaries in `examples/`: utility/export tools and pedagogical demos only (not per-reduction files)
- Test naming: `test_<source>_to_<target>_closed_loop`

### Paper (docs/paper/reductions.typ)
- `problem-def(name)[def][body]` — defines a problem with auto-generated schema, reductions list, and label `<def:ProblemName>`. Title comes from `display-name` dict.
- `reduction-rule(source, target, example: bool, ...)[rule][proof]` — generates a theorem with label `<thm:Source-to-Target>` and registers in `covered-rules` state. Overhead auto-derived from JSON edge data.
- Every directed reduction needs its own `reduction-rule` entry
- Completeness warnings auto-check that all JSON graph nodes/edges are covered in the paper
- `display-name` dict maps `ProblemName` to display text

## Testing Requirements

**Reference implementations — read these first:**
- **Reduction test:** `src/unit_tests/rules/minimumvertexcover_maximumindependentset.rs` — closed-loop pattern
- **Model test:** `src/unit_tests/models/graph/maximum_independent_set.rs` — evaluation, serialization
- **Solver test:** `src/unit_tests/solvers/brute_force.rs` — `find_best` + `find_satisfying`
- **Trait definitions:** `src/traits.rs` (`Problem`, `OptimizationProblem`), `src/solvers/mod.rs` (`Solver`)

### Coverage

New code must have >95% test coverage. Run `make coverage` to check.

### Naming

- Reduction tests: `test_<source>_to_<target>_closed_loop`
- Model tests: `test_<model>_basic`, `test_<model>_serialization`
- Solver tests: `test_<solver>_<problem>`

### Key Testing Patterns

See Key Patterns above for solver API signatures. Follow the reference files for exact usage.

### File Organization

Unit tests in `src/unit_tests/` linked via `#[path]` (see Core Modules above). Integration tests in `tests/suites/`, consolidated through `tests/main.rs`. Canonical example-db coverage lives in `src/unit_tests/example_db.rs`.

## Documentation Locations
- `README.md` — Project overview and quickstart
- `.claude/` — Claude Code instructions and skills
- `docs/book/` — mdBook user documentation (built with `make doc`)
- `docs/paper/reductions.typ` — Typst paper with problem definitions and reduction theorems
- `src/example_db/` — Canonical model/rule examples: `model_builders.rs`, `rule_builders.rs` (in-memory builders), `specs.rs` (per-module invariant specs), consumed by `pred create --example` and paper exports
- `examples/` — Export utilities, graph-analysis helpers, and pedagogical demos

## Documentation Requirements

**Reference:** search `docs/paper/reductions.typ` for `MinimumVertexCover` `MaximumIndependentSet` to see a complete problem-def + reduction-rule example.

### Adding a Problem Definition

```typst
#problem-def("ProblemName")[
  Mathematical definition...
][
  Background, examples, algorithms...
]
```

Also add to the `display-name` dictionary:
```typst
"ProblemName": [Problem Name],
```

### Adding a Reduction Theorem

```typst
#reduction-rule("Source", "Target",
  example: true,
  example-caption: [caption text],
)[
  Rule statement...
][
  Proof sketch...
]
```

Every directed reduction in the graph needs its own `reduction-rule` entry. The paper auto-checks completeness against `reduction_graph.json`.

## Complexity Verification Requirements

### Variant Worst-Case Complexity (`declare_variants!`)
The complexity string represents the **worst-case time complexity of the best known algorithm** for that problem variant. To verify correctness:
1. Identify the best known exact algorithm for the problem (name, author, year, citation)
2. Confirm the worst-case time bound from the original paper or a survey
3. Check that polynomial-time problems (e.g., MaximumMatching, 2-SAT, 2-Coloring) are NOT declared with exponential complexity
4. For NP-hard problems, verify the base of the exponential matches the literature (e.g., 1.1996^n for MIS, not 2^n)
5. Use only concrete numeric values — no symbolic constants (epsilon, omega); inline the actual numbers with citations
6. Variable names must match getter methods on the problem type (enforced at compile time)

### Reduction Overhead (`#[reduction(overhead = {...})]`)
Overhead expressions describe how target problem size relates to source problem size. To verify correctness:
1. Read the `reduce_to()` implementation and count the actual output sizes
2. Check that each field (e.g., `num_vertices`, `num_edges`, `num_sets`) matches the constructed target problem
3. Watch for common errors: universe elements mismatch (edge indices vs vertex indices), worst-case edge counts in intersection graphs (quadratic, not linear), constant factors in circuit constructions
4. Test with concrete small instances: construct a source problem, run the reduction, and compare target sizes against the formula
5. Ensure there is only one primitive reduction registration for each exact source/target variant pair; wrap shared helpers instead of registering duplicate endpoints
