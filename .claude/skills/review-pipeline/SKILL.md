# Review Pipeline

Pick PRs from the `review-agentic` column on the [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/orgs/CodingThrust/projects/8/views/1). For each PR: wait for Copilot review, fix Copilot comments, check and address issue/human comments, fix CI, run agentic feature tests, then move to `In Review`.

## Invocation

- `/review-pipeline` -- pick the next review-agentic item
- `/review-pipeline 570` -- process a specific PR number
- `/review-pipeline --all` -- batch-process all review-agentic items

## Constants

GitHub Project board IDs (for `gh project item-edit`):

| Constant | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `PROJECT_ID` | `PVT_kwDOBrtarc4BRNVy` |
| `STATUS_FIELD_ID` | `PVTSSF_lADOBrtarc4BRNVyzg_GmQc` |
| `STATUS_REVIEW_AGENTIC` | `b2f16561` |
| `STATUS_IN_REVIEW` | `df73e18b` |
| `STATUS_READY` | `61e4505c` |

## Prerequisites

- **agentic-tests** must be installed (`~/.claude/commands/agentic-tests:test-feature.md` must exist). If missing, STOP with: `agentic-tests not installed. Run: gh clone GiggleLiu/agentic-tests ~/.claude/agentic-tests && mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands && ln -s ~/.claude/agentic-tests/skills/test-feature/SKILL.md ~/.claude/commands/agentic-tests:test-feature.md`

## Autonomous Mode

This skill runs **fully autonomously** -- no confirmation prompts, no user questions.

## Steps

### 0. Discover review-agentic Items

```bash
gh project item-list 8 --owner CodingThrust --format json --limit 500
```

Filter items where `status == "review-agentic"`. Each item should have an associated PR. Extract the PR number from the item title or linked issue.

#### 0a. Check Copilot Review Status

For each candidate PR, check whether Copilot has already submitted a review:

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner)
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/reviews --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login == "copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]")] | length'
```

A PR is **eligible** only if the count is ≥ 1 (Copilot has submitted at least one review). PRs without a Copilot review yet are marked `[waiting for Copilot]` and skipped.

#### 0b. Print the List

Print all review-agentic items with their Copilot status:

```
review-agentic PRs:
  #570  Fix #117: [Model] GraphPartitioning     [copilot reviewed]
  #571  Fix #97: [Rule] BinPacking to ILP       [waiting for Copilot]
```

**If a specific PR number was provided:** verify it is in the review-agentic column. If it is waiting for Copilot, STOP with a message: `PR #N is waiting for Copilot review. Re-run after Copilot has reviewed.`

**If `--all`:** process only eligible (Copilot-reviewed) items in order (lowest PR number first). Skip waiting items.

**Otherwise:** pick the first eligible item. If no items are eligible, STOP with: `No review-agentic PRs have been reviewed by Copilot yet.`

### 1. Create Worktree and Checkout PR Branch

Create an isolated git worktree so the main working directory stays clean:

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner)
BRANCH=$(gh pr view $PR --json headRefName --jq .headRefName)
WORKTREE_DIR=".worktrees/review-$BRANCH"
mkdir -p .worktrees
git fetch origin $BRANCH
git worktree add "$WORKTREE_DIR" $BRANCH
cd "$WORKTREE_DIR"
```

All subsequent steps run inside the worktree.

### 1a. Resolve Conflicts with Main

Check if the branch has merge conflicts with main:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main --no-edit
```

- If the merge succeeds cleanly: push the merge commit and continue.
- If there are conflicts:
  1. Inspect the conflicting files with `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`.
  2. Resolve conflicts (prefer the PR branch for new code, main for regenerated artifacts like JSON).
  3. Stage resolved files, commit, and push.
- If conflicts are too complex to resolve automatically (e.g., overlapping logic changes in the same function): abort the merge (`git merge --abort`), leave the PR in review-agentic, and report: `PR #N has complex merge conflicts with main — needs manual resolution.` Then STOP processing this PR.

### 2. Fix Copilot Review Comments

Copilot review is guaranteed to exist (verified in Step 0). Fetch the comments:

```bash
COMMENTS=$(gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login == "copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]")]')
```

If there are actionable comments: invoke `/fix-pr` to address them, then push:

```bash
git push
```

If Copilot approved with no actionable comments: skip to next step.

### 2a. Check Issue Comments and Human PR Reviews

Extract the linked issue number from the PR title (pattern: `Fix #N:`):

```bash
ISSUE=$(gh pr view $PR --json title --jq .title | grep -oP '(?<=Fix #)\d+')
```

Fetch all comment sources:

```bash
# 1. Linked issue comments (from contributors, excluding bots)
if [ -n "$ISSUE" ]; then
    gh api repos/$REPO/issues/$ISSUE/comments | python3 -c "
import sys,json
comments = [c for c in json.load(sys.stdin) if not c['user']['login'].endswith('[bot]')]
print(f'=== Issue #{sys.argv[1]} comments: {len(comments)} ===')
for c in comments:
    print(f'[{c[\"user\"][\"login\"]}] {c[\"body\"][:300]}')
    print('---')
" "$ISSUE"
fi

# 2. Human PR review comments (inline, excluding Copilot)
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments | python3 -c "
import sys,json
comments = [c for c in json.load(sys.stdin) if not c['user']['login'].endswith('[bot]')]
print(f'=== Human PR inline comments: {len(comments)} ===')
for c in comments:
    line = c.get('line') or c.get('original_line') or '?'
    print(f'[{c[\"user\"][\"login\"]}] {c[\"path\"]}:{line} — {c[\"body\"][:300]}')
"

# 3. Human PR conversation comments (general discussion, excluding bots)
gh api repos/$REPO/issues/$PR/comments | python3 -c "
import sys,json
comments = [c for c in json.load(sys.stdin) if not c['user']['login'].endswith('[bot]')]
print(f'=== Human PR conversation comments: {len(comments)} ===')
for c in comments:
    print(f'[{c[\"user\"][\"login\"]}] {c[\"body\"][:300]}')
"

# 4. Human review-level comments (top-level review body)
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/reviews | python3 -c "
import sys,json
reviews = [r for r in json.load(sys.stdin) if not r['user']['login'].endswith('[bot]') and r.get('body')]
print(f'=== Human reviews: {len(reviews)} ===')
for r in reviews:
    print(f'[{r[\"user\"][\"login\"]}] {r[\"state\"]}: {r[\"body\"][:300]}')
"
```

For each actionable comment found:

1. **Read the relevant source files** referenced by the comment.
2. **Check if the comment's feedback is already addressed** in the current code.
3. **If not addressed:** fix the code to respect the comment, commit, and push.
4. **If already addressed:** move on.

Actionable comments include: code suggestions, bug reports, requests for additional tests, naming feedback, algorithmic corrections, and missing edge cases. Ignore comments that are purely informational or questions that have already been answered.

If there are no actionable unaddressed comments: skip to next step.

### 3. Agentic Feature Test (REQUIRED)

**This step is mandatory — do NOT skip or substitute with manual testing.**

Run agentic feature tests on the modified feature:

1. **Identify the feature** from the PR title and changed files:
   - `[Model]` PRs: the new problem model name
   - `[Rule]` PRs: the new reduction rule (source -> target)

2. **Invoke `/agentic-tests:test-feature`** with the identified feature. This simulates a downstream user exercising the feature from docs and examples. You MUST use the Skill tool to invoke `agentic-tests:test-feature`.

3. **If test-feature reports issues:** fix them, commit, and push.

4. **If test-feature passes:** continue to next step.

### 4. Fix Loop (max 3 retries)

For each retry:

1. **Wait for CI to complete** (poll every 30s, up to 15 minutes):
   ```bash
   for i in $(seq 1 30); do
       sleep 30
       HEAD_SHA=$(gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['head']['sha'])")
       STATUS=$(gh api repos/$REPO/commits/$HEAD_SHA/check-runs | python3 -c "
   import sys,json
   runs = json.load(sys.stdin)['check_runs']
   if not runs:
       print('PENDING')
   else:
       failed = [r['name'] for r in runs if r.get('conclusion') not in ('success', 'skipped', None)]
       pending = [r['name'] for r in runs if r.get('conclusion') is None and r['status'] != 'completed']
       if pending:
           print('PENDING')
       elif failed:
           print('FAILED')
       else:
           print('GREEN')
   ")
       if [ "$STATUS" != "PENDING" ]; then break; fi
   done
   ```

   - If `GREEN` on the **first** iteration (before any fix-pr): skip the fix loop, done.
   - If `GREEN` after a fix-pr pass: break, done.
   - If `FAILED`: continue to step 2.
   - If still `PENDING` after 15 min: treat as `FAILED`.

2. **Invoke `/fix-pr`** to address CI failures and coverage gaps.

3. **Push fixes:**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

4. Increment retry counter. If `< 3`, go back to step 1. If `= 3`, give up.

**After 3 failed retries:** leave PR open, still move to In Review for human triage.

### 5. Clean Up Worktree

```bash
cd "$REPO_ROOT"
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_DIR" --force
```

### 6. Move to "In Review"

```bash
gh project item-edit \
  --id <ITEM_ID> \
  --project-id PVT_kwDOBrtarc4BRNVy \
  --field-id PVTSSF_lADOBrtarc4BRNVyzg_GmQc \
  --single-select-option-id df73e18b
```

### 7. Report

```
Review pipeline complete:
  PR:     #570
  Copilot comments: 3 fixed
  Issue/human comments: 2 checked, 1 fixed
  CI:     green
  Agentic test: passed
  Board:  review-agentic -> In Review
```

### 8. Batch Mode (`--all`)

If `--all` was specified, repeat Steps 1-7 for each PR. After all PRs, print a batch report:

```
=== Review Pipeline Batch Report ===

| PR   | Title                              | Copilot | Issue/Human | CI      | Agentic Test | Board      |
|------|------------------------------------|---------|-------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| #570 | Fix #117: [Model] GraphPartitioning| 3 fixed | 1 fixed     | green   | passed       | In Review  |
| #571 | Fix #97: [Rule] BinPacking to ILP  | 0       | 0           | green   | passed       | In Review  |

Completed: 2/2 | All moved to In Review
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| PR not in review-agentic column | Verify status before processing; STOP if not review-agentic |
| Picking a PR before Copilot has reviewed | Check `pulls/$PR/reviews` for copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]; skip if absent |
| Missing project scopes | Run `gh auth refresh -s read:project,project` |
| Skipping agentic tests | Always run test-feature even if CI is green |
| Not checking out the right branch | Use `gh pr view` to get the exact branch name |
| Worktree left behind on failure | Always clean up with `git worktree remove` in Step 5 |
| Working in main checkout | All work happens in `.worktrees/` — never modify the main checkout |
| Skipping merge with main | Always merge origin/main in Step 1a to catch conflicts before fixing comments |
| Ignoring issue comments | Always check the linked issue (`Fix #N`) for human feedback in Step 2a |
| Only checking Copilot comments | Step 2a checks human PR reviews and linked issue comments too — bot-only review is insufficient |
