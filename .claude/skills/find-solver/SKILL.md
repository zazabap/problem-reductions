# Find Solver

Guide users from a real-world algorithmic problem to a concrete solving strategy. Produces a static solution doc in `docs/solutions/`.

## Invocation

```
/find-solver               — start from Step 1 (clarify problem)
/find-solver <ProblemName> — skip to Step 3 (explore reductions for a known model)
```

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT modify project source files, write Rust code, or create PRs.
Only outputs: `pred` CLI commands executed live, web searches, conversational commentary, and one solution doc in `docs/solutions/`.
If the user asks about contributing code, point them to `/add-model`, `/add-rule`, or `/propose`.
</HARD-GATE>

## Audience

This skill serves two types of users:

- **Practitioners** who have a fuzzy real-world problem (e.g., "I need to assign tasks to machines minimizing makespan") and need help identifying which NP-hard problem it maps to
- **Researchers** who already know the formal problem name and want to find the best reduction path + solver

Adapt the flow: if the user provides a formal problem name, validate it with `pred show` and skip directly to Step 3.

## Flow Overview

```
Step 1: Clarify Problem (skip if user knows the formal name)
Step 2: Match to Library Models (web search + pred list)
Step 3: Explore Reduction Paths (auto-explore via pred from --hops 3)
Step 4: Recommend Solvers (web search + pred solve options)
Step 5: Generate Solution Doc (docs/solutions/<name>.md)
```

## CRITICAL: Output Visibility

Bash tool results are hidden from the user in the Claude Code UI. **After every `pred` command, you MUST copy-paste the full stdout/stderr into your response as text.** The pattern for every command is:

1. Announce the command and why: "Let me run `pred to MIS` to see what MIS can be reduced to:"
2. Run the command via the Bash tool
3. Copy the COMPLETE output into your text response inside a fenced code block
4. Then add your brief explanation

Never skip step 1 or 3.

---

## Step 1: Clarify Problem

**Goal:** Understand the user's problem well enough to form a search query for matching models.

**Researcher shortcut:** If the user invoked `/find-solver <ProblemName>` or describes their problem using a formal name (e.g., "maximum independent set", "graph coloring"), run `pred show <name>` to validate it exists. If it does, skip directly to Step 3 with that model. If it doesn't exist in the library, tell the user and fall through to Step 2.

**For practitioners, ask one question at a time:**

1. "Describe your problem in plain language — what are you trying to optimize, decide, or compute?"

2. Based on the answer, if the input structure is ambiguous, ask:
   "Is your input a graph/network? A set of items? A boolean formula? Numbers/matrices?"

3. If the objective is unclear:
   "What's the objective — minimize something, maximize something, or check feasibility?"

4. "Roughly how large are your instances? (e.g., 10 nodes, 1000 variables)"

Use `AskUserQuestion` for each question. Format options as **(a)**/**(b)**/**(c)** when multiple choice is natural.

**Exit condition:** You have enough context to form a search query like "task scheduling minimize makespan NP-hard" or "maximum weight independent set unit disk graph". Proceed to Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Match to Library Models

**Goal:** Identify which problem model(s) in the library match the user's problem.

**Key rule:** Web search happens BEFORE presenting options. Never guess model matches from internal knowledge alone.

**Actions:**

1. **Web search** the clarified problem description together with terms like "NP-hard", "computational complexity", or "reduction" to find formal problem names and known relationships in the literature. Use `WebSearch` tool.

2. **Run `pred list`** to get the full catalog of available models. Copy-paste the full output into your response.

3. **Cross-reference** the web search results against the `pred list` catalog. For each candidate model that exists in the library (3-5 max), present a table:

| # | Model | Why it might match | Caveat |
|---|-------|--------------------|--------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... |
| 3 | ... | ... | ... |

**Include a recommendation:** Bold or mark the option you think is the best fit, with a brief reason why.

4. For each candidate, run `pred show <model>` and show the output — fields, complexity, available reductions. This helps the user see what data they would need to provide.

5. **Check optimization vs decision mismatch.** If the user's goal is "minimize X" or "maximize X" but the matched model is a decision/feasibility problem (Value = `Or`, fields include a `deadline`/`bound`), explain the gap:
   - "This model checks feasibility ('can it be done within bound D?'), not optimization directly."
   - "To find the optimum, we'll binary search on the bound parameter."
   - This is common for scheduling problems (deadline), knapsack (bound), etc.

6. **Ask the user to pick one** using `AskUserQuestion`. If none fit, ask the user for more detail and re-run the web search with refined keywords.

**Proceed to Step 3 with the chosen model.**

---

## Step 3: Explore Reduction Paths

**Goal:** Discover all solver-ready targets reachable from the chosen model and present them ranked.

**Actions:**

1. **Run `pred from <model> --hops 3`** to find all problems reachable via outgoing reductions within 3 hops. Copy-paste the full output.

2. **For each reachable problem**, gather info:
   - Run `pred path <model> <target>` to get the cheapest witness-capable reduction path and composed overhead
   - **IMPORTANT:** Use the exact variant-qualified name from `pred from` output (e.g., `SpinGlass/SimpleGraph/f64`, not bare `SpinGlass`). Bare names resolve to the default variant, which may differ from the reachable variant and cause false "no path" errors.
   - Run `pred show <target>` to get its best-known complexity
   - Check if it's a solver-ready target (ILP, QUBO, SAT) or has a path to one via `pred path <target> ILP`

3. **Present a ranked table** (most practical paths first — fewest hops, lowest overhead). **Mark a recommendation** for the most practical path:

   | # | Target | Hops | Composed Overhead | Target Complexity | Solver-Ready? |
   |---|--------|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
   | 1 | ILP | 2 | num_vars = 2*n + m | O(2^num_vars) | Yes (is ILP) |
   | 2 | QUBO | 1 | num_vars = n | O(2^num_vars) | Yes (is QUBO) |
   | 3 | MaxSetPacking | 1 | num_sets = n | O(2^num_sets) | Yes (ILP in 2 steps) |

   When overhead grows significantly between options (e.g., linear vs quadratic), note the practical implication: "QUBO adds quadratic variable blowup — prefer this only if targeting quantum/annealing hardware."

4. **Ask the user** using `AskUserQuestion`: "Which reduction path would you like to use? Pick a number."

**If `pred from --hops 3` returns more than 15 results:** present only the top 10 by overhead and mention the rest are available.

**Proceed to Step 4 with the chosen path.**

## Step 4: Recommend Solvers

**Goal:** Find the best solver options — both built-in and external — for the target problem.

**Key rule:** Web search happens BEFORE presenting solver options. Do not recommend solvers from internal knowledge alone.

**Actions:**

1. **Web search** the final target problem + "solver" + "benchmark" + "library" to find state-of-the-art external tools. Use `WebSearch` tool. Example queries:
   - "QUBO solver open source benchmark"
   - "integer linear programming solver comparison"
   - "maximum independent set practical solver"

2. **Check built-in solver availability:**
   - Run `pred path <current_model> ILP` — if a path exists, `pred solve --solver ilp` is available
   - `pred solve --solver brute-force` is always available (feasible for small instances, ~25 variables)

3. **Present solver options** in a table:

   | # | Solver | Type | How to Use | Notes |
   |---|--------|------|------------|-------|
   | 1 | pred solve --solver ilp | Built-in | pred solve reduced.json | HiGHS backend |
   | 2 | pred solve --solver brute-force | Built-in | pred solve problem.json --solver brute-force | Exact, small instances only |
   | 3 | (from web search) | External | (brief setup) | (strengths/limitations) |
   | 4 | (from web search) | External | (brief setup) | (strengths/limitations) |

4. **Ask the user** which solver(s) to include in the solution doc using `AskUserQuestion`.

**Proceed to Step 5 with the selected solver(s).**

---

## Step 5: Generate Solution Doc

**Goal:** Write a static reference document with everything the user needs to solve their problem.

**File path:** `docs/solutions/<problem>-via-<model>-<solver>.md`

Where:
- `<problem>` is a short kebab-case description of the real-world problem
- `<model>` is the library model name (e.g., `MIS`, `QUBO`)
- `<solver>` is the primary solver (e.g., `ILP`, `brute-force`, `gurobi`)

Ask the user to confirm the filename before writing.

**Doc template — write all sections:**

```markdown
# <Real-world Problem> via <Model> -> <Solver>

## Problem Description

<What the user described, formalized. One paragraph.>

## Matched Model

- **Name:** <ProblemType> {variant}
- **Why this model:** <reasoning from Step 2>
- **Best-known complexity:** O(...)

## Input Schema

<JSON schema from `pred show --json <model>`, with field explanations.>

Example instance:

```json
<Run `pred create --example <model/variant>` and paste the JSON output>
```

## Reduction Path

<For each step in the path chosen during Step 3:>

### Step N: <Source> -> <Target>

- **Overhead:** <field-by-field from pred show>

```bash
pred reduce input.json --to <Target> -o step_N.json
```

## Solving

```bash
pred solve step_N.json --solver ilp --timeout 60
```

<Explain what the output means for the user's original problem.
E.g., "Max(3) means the maximum independent set has 3 vertices."
For decision problems: "Or(true) means a feasible solution exists within the bound.">

## Finding the Optimum (decision models only)

<Include this section when the matched model is a decision/feasibility problem (Value = Or)
with a bound parameter like `deadline`, `bound`, or `capacity`.>

The model checks feasibility ("can it be done within bound D?"), not optimization directly.
To find the minimum/maximum, binary search on the bound parameter:

```bash
# Binary search for minimum deadline
# Upper bound: sum of all task lengths (trivially feasible with 1 processor)
# Lower bound: max(longest task, ceil(total / num_processors))
# Try midpoint, narrow based on Or(true)/Or(false)
```

## Solution Extraction

<Explain how the target solution maps back to the original problem.>

Using the reduction bundle workflow (recommended):

```bash
pred reduce input.json --to <FinalTarget> -o bundle.json
pred solve bundle.json --solver ilp --timeout 60
```

The solver automatically extracts the solution back to the original problem space.

## External Solver Alternatives

<For each external solver chosen in Step 4:>

### <Solver Name>

- **What:** <one-line description>
- **When to prefer:** <when this is better than built-in>
- **How to use:** <brief setup or export instructions, if applicable>

## Quick Reference

All commands in sequence:

```bash
# 1. Create your problem instance
pred create <Model> <flags> -o input.json

# 2. Reduce to solver-ready form
pred reduce input.json --to <FinalTarget> -o bundle.json

# 3. Solve
pred solve bundle.json --solver ilp --timeout 60

# 4. Verify (optional)
pred evaluate input.json --config <solution_vector>
```
```

**After writing the doc:**

1. Show the user the generated filename and a brief summary of what's in it.
2. **If a built-in solver covers the chosen path** (brute-force or ILP), offer to run a live demo with the example instance: "Want me to run the example end-to-end so you can see it in action?"
3. Ask if they want to make any changes before finishing.

## Key Behaviors

- **One question at a time.** Never ask multiple questions in one message. Use `AskUserQuestion` for every decision point.
- **Web search before recommendations.** In Step 2 (model matching) and Step 4 (solver recommendation), always web search first. Never rely on internal knowledge alone.
- **Show full output.** After every Bash tool call, copy-paste the COMPLETE output into your text response as a fenced code block. Bash tool results are hidden in the UI.
- **Announce every command.** Before running, say what command you're using and why.
- **Always use variant-qualified names in `pred path`.** When `pred from` returns names like `SpinGlass/SimpleGraph/f64`, use that exact string in subsequent `pred path` calls. Bare names (e.g., `SpinGlass`) resolve to the default variant, which may differ from the reachable variant and cause false "no path" errors.
- **Recommend, don't just list.** When presenting options (models in Step 2, paths in Step 3, solvers in Step 4), always bold or mark your recommended choice with a brief reason. The user can still pick freely.
- **Compact formatting.** Write explanations as plain paragraphs. Do not use blockquote `>` syntax for explanations. Keep tight: command announcement, code block output, 1-3 sentence explanation.
- **Conversational tone.** Guided consultation, not a lecture.
- **Live execution.** Every `pred` command runs for real. No fake output.
- **Graceful fallbacks.** If a path doesn't exist or a command fails, explain what happened and suggest alternatives (try another model, use brute-force, backtrack).
- **Adapt to user level.** If the user gives a formal problem name, skip clarification. If they describe a fuzzy real-world problem, ask follow-ups one at a time.
- **Use `--timeout 30`** with `pred solve` in any live demos during the session.
- **Doc template sections are conditional.** "Finding the Optimum" only applies to decision models. "External Solver Alternatives" only applies when external solvers were chosen. "Solution Extraction" can be folded into "Solving" when the bundle workflow handles it automatically.
