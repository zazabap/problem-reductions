# Issue to PR

Convert a GitHub issue into a PR: write a plan, create the PR, then execute the plan using subagent-driven-development.

## Invocation

- `/issue-to-pr 42` — create PR with plan, then execute (for `[Rule]` issues, verification runs by default)
- `/issue-to-pr 42 --no-verify` — skip mathematical verification for `[Rule]` issues

For Codex, open this `SKILL.md` directly and treat the slash-command forms above as aliases. The Makefile `run-issue` target already does this translation.

## Workflow

```
Receive issue number
    -> Fetch structured issue preflight report
    -> Verify Good label and rule-model guards
    -> If guards fail: STOP
    -> If guards pass: research references, write plan, create or resume PR
    -> Execute plan via subagent-driven-development
```

## Steps

### 1. Parse Input

Extract issue number, repo, and flags from arguments:
- `123` -> issue #123
- `https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123` -> issue #123
- `owner/repo#123` -> issue #123 in owner/repo

Normalize to:
- `ISSUE=<number>`
- `REPO=<owner/repo>` (default `CodingThrust/problem-reductions`)
- `EXECUTE=true|false`
- `NO_VERIFY=true|false` (default `false`; pass `--no-verify` to skip mathematical verification for `[Rule]` issues)

### 2. Fetch Issue + Preflight Guards

```bash
ISSUE_JSON=$(python3 scripts/pipeline_checks.py issue-context \
  --repo "$REPO" \
  --issue "$ISSUE" \
  --format json)
```

This `issue-context` packet is the expensive deterministic preflight call for `issue-to-pr`. It is allowed exactly once per top-level `issue-to-pr` invocation. After it succeeds, reuse `ISSUE_JSON` for all later guards, resume/create decisions, and summaries instead of calling `issue-context` again.

Treat `ISSUE_JSON` as the source of truth for the deterministic preflight data:
- `title`, `body`, `labels`, and `comments` provide the issue summary and comment thread
- `kind`, `source_problem`, and `target_problem` provide parsed issue metadata
- `checks.good_label`, `checks.source_model`, and `checks.target_model` provide guard outcomes
- `existing_prs`, `resume_pr`, and `action` tell you whether to resume an open PR instead of creating a new one

Present the issue summary to the user. **Also review all comments** — contributors and maintainers may have posted clarifications, corrections, additional context, or design decisions that refine or override parts of the original issue body. Incorporate relevant comment content when writing the plan.

### 3. Verify Issue Has Passed check-issue

The issue must have already passed the `check-issue` quality gate (Stage 1 validation). Do NOT re-validate the issue here.

Use `ISSUE_JSON.checks.good_label`:
- If it is `fail` → **STOP**: "Issue #N has not passed check-issue. Please run `/check-issue <N>` first."
- If it is `pass` → continue.

### 3.5. Model-Existence Guard (for `[Rule]` issues only)

For `[Rule]` issues, `ISSUE_JSON` already includes `source_problem`, `target_problem`, and the deterministic model-existence checks.

- If both `checks.source_model` and `checks.target_model` are `pass` → continue to step 4.
- If either is `fail` → **STOP**. Comment on the issue: "Blocked: model `<name>` does not exist in main yet. Please implement it first (or file a `[Model]` issue)."

**One item per PR, with one exception:** Do NOT implement a missing model as part of a `[Rule]` PR. `[Rule]` issues still require both models to exist on `main`. The only exception is a `[Model]` issue that explicitly claims direct ILP solvability: that PR should implement both the model and the direct `<Model> -> ILP` rule together.

### 4. Research References

Use web search to look up the reference URL provided in the issue. This helps:
- Clarify the formal problem definition and notation
- Understand the reduction algorithm in detail (variable mapping, penalty terms, proof of correctness)
- Resolve any ambiguities in the issue description without bothering the contributor

If the reference is a paper or textbook, search for accessible summaries, lecture notes, or Wikipedia articles on the same reduction.

### 5. Write Plan

Write implementation plan to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` using `superpowers`.

The plan MUST reference the appropriate implementation skill and follow its steps:

- **For ordinary `[Model]` issues:** Follow [add-model](../add-model/SKILL.md) Steps 1-7 as the action pipeline
- **For `[Model]` issues that explicitly claim direct ILP solving:** Follow [add-model](../add-model/SKILL.md) Steps 1-7 **and** [add-rule](../add-rule/SKILL.md) Steps 1-6 for the direct `<Problem> -> ILP` rule in the same plan / PR
- **For `[Rule]` issues:** Follow [add-rule](../add-rule/SKILL.md) Steps 1-7 as the action pipeline. By default, `/add-rule` runs mathematical verification (Step 1) before implementation. If `--no-verify` was passed, include `--no-verify` when invoking `/add-rule` to skip verification.

Include the concrete details from the issue (problem definition, reduction algorithm, example, etc.) mapped onto each step.

**Plan batching:** The paper writing step (add-model Step 6 / add-rule Step 5) MUST be in a **separate batch** from the implementation steps, so it gets its own subagent with fresh context. It depends on the implementation being complete (needs exports). Example batch structure for a `[Model]` plan:
- Batch 1: Steps 1-5.5 (implement model, register, CLI, tests)
- Batch 2: Step 6 (write paper entry — depends on batch 1 for exports)

For a `[Model]` issue with an explicit direct ILP claim, use:
- Batch 1: implement the model, register it, add the direct `<Problem> -> ILP` rule, and add model + rule tests
- Batch 2: write both the `problem-def(...)` and `reduction-rule(...)` paper entries, regenerate exports / fixtures, and run final ILP-enabled verification

**Solver rules:**
- Ensure at least one solver is provided in the issue template. Check if the solving strategy is valid. If not, reply under issue to ask for clarification.
- If a `[Model]` issue explicitly claims direct ILP solving, implement the model and the direct `<Problem> -> ILP` reduction together in the same PR. Do not leave the ILP rule as a follow-up.
- The direct ILP rule must meet the same completeness bar as a standalone production ILP reduction: exact overhead metadata, feature-gated registration, strong closed-loop / extraction / weighted / infeasible / pathological tests when applicable, CLI/example-db/paper integration, and ILP-enabled workspace verification.
- Otherwise, ensure the information provided is enough to implement a solver.

**Example rules:**
- Implement the user-provided example instance in the canonical `example_db` path for the issue (`src/example_db/model_builders.rs` or `src/example_db/rule_builders.rs`, as appropriate).
- Run the relevant export and fixture regeneration steps; verify the generated example data against the user-provided information.
- Present in `docs/paper/reductions.typ` in tutorial style with clear intuition (see KColoring->QUBO section for reference).

### 6. Create PR (or Resume Existing)

Use the `ISSUE_JSON.action` and `ISSUE_JSON.resume_pr` fields from Step 2.

**Validate `resume_pr` before trusting it:** If `action == "resume-pr"`, verify that `resume_pr.head_ref_name` contains the current issue number (e.g., branch name includes `issue-{N}`). If it doesn't match, treat as `action = "create-pr"` instead — the script may have matched an unrelated PR.

**If an open PR already exists** (`action == "resume-pr"`, validated):
- Switch to its branch: `git checkout <resume_pr.head_ref_name>`
- Capture `PR=<resume_pr.number>`
- Skip plan creation — jump directly to Step 7 (execute)

**Worktree-aware branching:** If you are already inside a `run-pipeline` worktree (the CWD is under `.worktrees/`), the branch is already created — skip `prepare-issue-branch` and use the current branch directly. Only call `prepare-issue-branch` when running standalone (not inside a worktree).

**If no open PR exists** (`action == "create-pr"`) — create one with only the plan file:

```bash
# If NOT inside a worktree: prepare or reuse the issue branch
# (skip this if already in a run-pipeline worktree — branch already exists)
BRANCH_JSON=$(python3 scripts/pipeline_worktree.py prepare-issue-branch \
  --issue <number> \
  --slug <slug> \
  --base main \
  --format json)
BRANCH=$(printf '%s\n' "$BRANCH_JSON" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['branch'])")
# If inside a worktree, just use: BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Stage the plan file
git add docs/plans/<plan-file>.md

# Commit
git commit -m "Add plan for #<number>: <title>"

# Push
git push -u origin "$BRANCH"

# Create PR body
PR_BODY_FILE=$(mktemp)
cat > "$PR_BODY_FILE" <<'EOF'
## Summary
<Brief description>

Fixes #<number>
EOF

# Create PR and capture the created PR number
PR_JSON=$(python3 scripts/pipeline_pr.py create \
  --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "Fix #<number>: <title>" \
  --body-file "$PR_BODY_FILE" \
  --base main \
  --head "$BRANCH" \
  --format json)
PR=$(printf '%s\n' "$PR_JSON" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['pr_number'])")
rm -f "$PR_BODY_FILE"
```

### 7. Execute Plan

#### 7a. Implement

Execute the plan using `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`:

1. **Read the plan** from `docs/plans/<plan-file>.md`
2. **Clear context** — summarize only the plan content and essential file paths, then invoke subagent-driven-development with a clean prompt. Do not carry forward research notes, issue comments, or other accumulated context from prior steps.
3. **Invoke subagent-driven-development** with the plan as input — this dispatches parallel subagents for independent tasks in the plan

If execution fails, leave the PR open with the plan commit only — the user can run `make run-plan` manually later. Skip remaining sub-steps.

#### 7b. Commit

Structural and quality review is handled by the `review-pipeline` stage, not here. The run stage just needs to produce working code.

Ensure all implementation changes are committed before cleanup. A small coherent commit stack is acceptable, especially when resuming an existing PR or integrating subagent work; do not rewrite history just to collapse commits. If there are still uncommitted implementation changes, commit them now:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Implement #<number>: <title>"
```

#### 7c. Clean Up Plan File

Delete the plan file from the branch — it served its purpose during implementation and should not be merged into main:

```bash
git rm docs/plans/<plan-file>.md
git commit -m "chore: remove plan file after implementation"
```

#### 7d. Push and Post Summary

Post an implementation summary comment on the PR **before** pushing. This comment should:
- Summarize what was implemented (files added/changed)
- Highlight any **deviations from the plan** — design changes, unexpected issues, or workarounds discovered during implementation
- Note any open questions or trade-offs made

```bash
COMMENT_FILE=$(mktemp)
cat > "$COMMENT_FILE" <<'EOF'
## Implementation Summary

### Changes
- [list of files added/modified and what they do]

### Deviations from Plan
- [any design changes, accidents, or workarounds — or "None"]

### Open Questions
- [any trade-offs or items needing review — or "None"]
EOF
python3 scripts/pipeline_pr.py comment --repo "$REPO" --pr "$PR" --body-file "$COMMENT_FILE"
rm -f "$COMMENT_FILE"

# Repo verification may regenerate ignored doc exports (notably after `make paper`).
# Inspect the tree once more before pushing.
git status --short

# Generated doc exports under docs/src/reductions/ are ignored; do not stage them.

# The issue plan file must be gone before push.
test ! -e docs/plans/<plan-file>.md

git push
```

#### 7e. Done

Report final status:
- PR URL and number
- Implementation summary

The PR is **not merged** and review is **not** handled here. The separate `review-pipeline` skill picks up PRs from the `Review pool` board column to run agentic review (structural check, quality check, agentic feature tests).

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Issue not checked | Run `/check-issue <N>` first — issue-to-pr requires it |
| Issue has failure labels | Fix the issue, re-run `/check-issue`, then retry |
| Including implementation code in initial PR | First PR: plan only |
| Generic plan | Use specifics from the issue, mapped to add-model/add-rule steps |
| Skipping CLI registration in plan | add-model still requires alias/create/example-db planning, but not manual CLI dispatch-table edits |
| Not verifying facts from issue | Use WebSearch/WebFetch to cross-check claims |
| Branch already exists on retry | Use `pipeline_worktree.py prepare-issue-branch` — it will reuse the existing branch instead of failing on `git checkout -b` |
| Dirty working tree | Use `pipeline_worktree.py prepare-issue-branch` — it stops before branching if the worktree is dirty |
| Resuming wrong PR | Always validate `resume_pr.head_ref_name` contains `issue-{N}` before trusting it — GitHub search can return false positives |
| `prepare-issue-branch` inside worktree | Skip it when inside a `run-pipeline` worktree (CWD under `.worktrees/`) — the branch already exists |
| Bundling unrelated model + rule in one PR | Keep the normal one-item-per-PR rule. The only exception is a `[Model]` issue that explicitly claims direct ILP solving, which should ship with its direct `<Model> -> ILP` rule |
| Plan files left in PR | Delete plan files before final push (Step 7c) |
| `make paper` or export steps changed tracked JSON after verification | Run `git status --short`, stage expected generated exports, and STOP if unexpected files remain before push |
