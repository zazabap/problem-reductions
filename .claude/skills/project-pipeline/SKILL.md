# Project Pipeline

Pick a "Ready" issue from the [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/orgs/CodingThrust/projects/8/views/1), claim it into "In Progress", run `issue-to-pr --execute`, then move it to "Review pool". The separate `review-pipeline` handles Copilot comments, CI fixes, and agentic testing.

## Invocation

- `/project-pipeline` -- pick the highest-ranked Ready issue (ranked by importance, relatedness, pending rules)
- `/project-pipeline 97` -- process a specific issue number from the Ready column
- `/project-pipeline --all` -- batch-process all Ready issues in ranked order

For Codex, open this `SKILL.md` directly and treat the slash-command forms above as aliases. The Makefile `run-pipeline` target already does this translation.

## Constants

GitHub Project board IDs (for `gh project item-edit`):

| Constant | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `PROJECT_ID` | `PVT_kwDOBrtarc4BRNVy` |
| `STATUS_FIELD_ID` | `PVTSSF_lADOBrtarc4BRNVyzg_GmQc` |
| `STATUS_READY` | `f37d0d80` |
| `STATUS_IN_PROGRESS` | `a12cfc9c` |
| `STATUS_REVIEW_POOL` | `7082ed60` |
| `STATUS_UNDER_REVIEW` | `f04790ca` |
| `STATUS_FINAL_REVIEW` | `51a3d8bb` |
| `STATUS_DONE` | `6aca54fa` |

## Autonomous Mode

This skill runs **fully autonomously** — no confirmation prompts, no user questions. It picks the next issue and processes it end-to-end. All sub-skills (`issue-to-pr`, `check-issue`, `add-model`, `add-rule`, etc.) should also auto-approve any confirmation prompts.

## Steps

### 0. Generate the Project-Pipeline Report

Step 0 should be a single report-generation step. Do not manually list Ready items, list In-progress items, grep model declarations, or re-derive blocked rules with separate shell commands.
The expensive full-context call here is `python3 scripts/pipeline_skill_context.py project-pipeline ...` (backed by `build_project_pipeline_context()`). For a single top-level `project-pipeline` invocation, call it once and reuse the packet for scoring, ranking, and choosing the issue. Do not rerun it in the single-issue path after the packet exists.

```bash
set -- python3 scripts/pipeline_skill_context.py project-pipeline --repo CodingThrust/problem-reductions --repo-root . --format text

# If a specific issue number was provided, validate it through the same bundle:
# set -- "$@" --issue <number>

REPORT=$("$@")
printf '%s\n' "$REPORT"
```

The report is the Step 0 packet. It should already include:
- Queue Summary
- Eligible Ready Issues
- Blocked Ready Issues
- In Progress Issues
- Requested Issue validation when a specific issue was supplied

Branch from the report:
- `Bundle status: empty` => STOP with `No Ready issues are currently available.`
- `Bundle status: no-eligible-issues` => STOP with `Ready issues exist, but all current rule candidates are blocked by missing models on main.`
- `Bundle status: requested-missing` => STOP with `Issue #N is not currently in the Ready column.`
- `Bundle status: requested-blocked` => STOP with the blocking reason from the report
- `Bundle status: ready` => continue

The report already handled the deterministic setup:
- it loaded the Ready and In-progress issue sets
- it scanned existing problems on main
- it marked blocked `[Rule]` issues whose source or target model is still missing
- it computed the pending-rule unblock counts used for C3

#### 0a. Score Eligible Issues

Score only **eligible** issues on three criteria. For `[Model]` issues, extract the problem name. For `[Rule]` issues, extract both source and target problem names.

| Criterion | Weight | How to Assess |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **C1: Industrial/Theoretical Importance** | 3 | Read the report's issue summary for each eligible issue. Score 0-2: **2** = widely used in industry or foundational in complexity theory (e.g., ILP, SAT, MaxFlow, TSP, GraphColoring); **1** = moderately important or well-studied (e.g., SubsetSum, SetCover, Knapsack); **0** = niche or primarily academic |
| **C2: Related to Existing Problems** | 2 | Use the report's Ready/In-progress context plus `pred list` if needed. Score 0-2: **2** = directly related (shares input structure or has known reductions to/from ≥2 existing problems, but is NOT a trivial variant of an existing one); **1** = loosely related (same domain, connects to 1 existing problem); **0** = isolated or is essentially a variant/renaming of an existing problem |
| **C3: Unblocks Pending Rules** | 2 | Read the `Pending rules unblocked` count already printed in the report for each eligible issue. Score 0-2: **2** = unblocks ≥2 pending rules; **1** = unblocks 1 pending rule; **0** = does not unblock any pending rule |

**Final score** = C1 × 3 + C2 × 2 + C3 × 2 (max = 12)

**Tie-breaking:** Models before Rules, then by lower issue number.

**Important for C2:** A problem that is merely a weighted/unweighted variant or a graph-subtype specialization of an existing problem scores **0** on C2, not 2. The goal is to add genuinely new problem types that expand the graph's reach.

#### 0b. Print Ranked List

Print all Ready issues with their scores for visibility (no confirmation needed). Blocked rules appear at the bottom with their reason:

```
Ready issues (ranked):
  Score  Issue  Title                              C1  C2  C3
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    10   #117   [Model] GraphPartitioning           2   2   2
     8   #129   [Model] MultivariateQuadratic       2   1   1
     7   #97    [Rule] BinPacking to ILP            1   2   1
     6   #110   [Rule] LCS to ILP                   1   1   1
     4   #126   [Rule] KSatisfiability to SubsetSum  0   2   0

  Blocked:
     3   #130   [Rule] MultivariateQuadratic to ILP  -- model "MultivariateQuadratic" not yet implemented
```

#### 0c. Pick Issues

**If a specific issue number was provided:** validate and claim it through the scripted bundle:

```bash
STATE_FILE=/tmp/problemreductions-ready-selection.json
CLAIM=$(python3 scripts/pipeline_board.py claim-next ready "$STATE_FILE" --number <number> --format json)
```

The report should already have stopped you before this point if the requested issue was missing or blocked.

After successful validation, extract `ITEM_ID`, `ISSUE`, and `TITLE` from `CLAIM` using the same commands shown below.

**If `--all`:** proceed with all eligible issues in ranked order (highest score first). Models before Rules at same score. Blocked rules are skipped. After each issue is processed, regenerate the report before the next claim, because a just-merged Model may unblock pending rules. This is the only normal case in this skill where a second full-context packet is expected.

**Otherwise (no args):** score the eligible issues from the report, pick the highest-scored one, and proceed immediately (no confirmation). After picking the issue number, claim it through the scripted bundle:

```bash
STATE_FILE=/tmp/problemreductions-ready-selection.json
CLAIM=$(python3 scripts/pipeline_board.py claim-next ready "$STATE_FILE" --number <chosen-issue-number> --format json)
```

Extract the board item metadata from `CLAIM`:

```bash
ITEM_ID=$(printf '%s\n' "$CLAIM" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['item_id'])")
ISSUE=$(printf '%s\n' "$CLAIM" | python3 -c "import sys,json; data=json.load(sys.stdin); print(data['issue_number'] or data['number'])")
TITLE=$(printf '%s\n' "$CLAIM" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['title'])")
```

### 1. Create Worktree

Create an isolated git worktree for this issue. The script automatically checks for an existing open PR — if one exists, it checks out that PR branch (treating it as an incomplete implementation); otherwise it creates a fresh worktree from `origin/main`:

```bash
WORKTREE=$(python3 scripts/pipeline_worktree.py worktree-for-issue \
  --repo "$REPO" --issue "$ISSUE" --slug <slug> --format json)
ACTION=$(printf '%s\n' "$WORKTREE" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['action'])")
WORKTREE_DIR=$(printf '%s\n' "$WORKTREE" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['worktree_dir'])")
cd "$WORKTREE_DIR"
```

- `action == "resume-pr"`: existing PR checked out — `issue-to-pr` will skip plan creation and jump to execution
- `action == "create-worktree"`: fresh branch from `origin/main`

All subsequent steps run inside the worktree. This ensures the user's main checkout is never modified.

### 2. Claim Result

`claim-next ready` has already moved the selected issue from `Ready` to `In progress`. Keep using `ITEM_ID` from the `CLAIM` JSON payload for later board transitions.

### 3. Run issue-to-pr --execute

Invoke the `issue-to-pr` skill with `--execute` (working directory is the worktree):

```
/issue-to-pr "$ISSUE" --execute
```

This handles the full pipeline: fetch issue, verify Good label, research, write plan, create PR, implement, review, fix CI. If an existing PR was detected in Step 1, `issue-to-pr` will resume it (skip plan creation, jump to execution).

**If `issue-to-pr` fails after creating a PR:** record the failure, but still move the issue to "Final review" so it's visible for human triage. Report the failure to the user.

### 4. Move to "Review pool"

After `issue-to-pr` succeeds, move the issue to the `Review pool` column and request a Copilot review so the review pipeline can pick it up:

```bash
python3 scripts/pipeline_board.py move <ITEM_ID> review-pool
gh copilot-review <PR_NUMBER>
```

The Copilot review request is required — without it, `run-review-forever` will not detect the PR as eligible.

**If `issue-to-pr` failed after creating a PR:** move the issue to `Final review` instead so a human can take over:

```bash
python3 scripts/pipeline_board.py move <ITEM_ID> final-review
```

**If no PR was created** (issue-to-pr failed before creating a PR): move the issue back to "Ready" instead:

```bash
python3 scripts/pipeline_board.py move <ITEM_ID> ready
```

### 5. Clean Up Worktree

After the issue is processed (success or failure), clean up the worktree:

```bash
cd "$REPO_ROOT"
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_DIR" --force
```

### 6. Report (single issue)

Print a summary:

```
Pipeline complete:
  Issue:  #97 [Rule] BinPacking to ILP
  PR:     #200
  Status: Awaiting agentic review
  Board:  Moved Ready -> In Progress -> Review pool
```

### 7. Batch Mode (`--all`)

If `--all` was specified, repeat Steps 1-6 for each issue in order. Each issue gets its own worktree (created and cleaned up per issue).

After all issues, print a batch report:

```
=== Project Pipeline Batch Report ===

| Issue | Title                              | PR   | Status      | Board       |
|-------|------------------------------------|------|-------------|-------------|
| #129  | [Model] MultivariateQuadratic      | #201 | CI green    | Review pool |
| #97   | [Rule] BinPacking to ILP           | #202 | CI green    | Review pool |
| #110  | [Rule] LCS to ILP                  | #203 | fix failed  | Review pool |
| #126  | [Rule] KSat to SubsetSum           | -    | plan failed | Ready       |

Completed: 2/4 | Review pool: 3 | Returned to Ready: 1
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Issue not in Ready column | Verify status before processing; STOP if not Ready |
| Picking a Rule whose model doesn't exist | Hard constraint: both source and target models must exist on `main` — pending Model issues do NOT count |
| Missing project scopes | Run `gh auth refresh -s read:project,project` |
| Forgetting to move back to Ready on total failure | Only move to Review pool if a PR exists |
| Processing Rules before their Model dependencies | In `--all` mode, re-check eligibility after each issue — a just-merged Model may unblock rules |
| Scoring a variant as "related" | Weighted/unweighted variants or graph-subtype specializations of existing problems score 0 on C2 |
| Not syncing main between batch issues | Each issue gets a fresh worktree from `origin/main` |
| Worktree left behind on failure | Always clean up with `git worktree remove` in Step 5 |
| Working in main checkout | All work happens in `.worktrees/` — never modify the main checkout |
| Missing items from project board | `gh project item-list` defaults to 30 items — always use `--limit 500` |
| Creating a fresh branch when PR exists | Check `issue-context` action field first — use `checkout-pr` for existing PRs instead of `create-issue` |
